**Bug**- A bug is an error, flaw, or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways.

**Permissions**- Permissions refer to the levels of access and actions that users are allowed to perform within a system or application. This can include read, write, delete, and other specific actions related to data and system functionality.

**Change**- In the context of backlog requests, a change request refers to a formal proposal for an alteration in the system, software, process, or any other aspect of a project. This can include changes to features, functionalities, or workflows.

**Update**- An update request pertains to a request to modify or refresh a software application, system, or any technology-related component with new features, improvements, or fixes.

**Automation**- Automation requests involve the implementation of processes and technologies to perform tasks with minimal human intervention. This can include requests to automate repetitive tasks, streamline workflows, or implement new automated functionalities.

**Enhancement**- An enhancement request involves a proposal to improve or extend the features, performance, or usability of a system, software, or application beyond its current state.

**Note**: an update is generally focused on refreshing existing features and addressing specific issues, an enhancement aims to bring about broader improvements and advancements to the overall product experience.

# Priority
**High** is anything that affects current work, e.g., not getting the basic functionality of the website

**Medium** is not as high a priority but should be considered before adopting “Low” priority items

**Low **is something that would make tasking easier but not necessary for functionality

**Critical**  items are those that need to be prioritized before all other requests as they are needed to perform daily PMO responsibilities.
